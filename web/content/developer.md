I work in open source software development in UK Higher Education having previously worked in IT and librarianship for many years. I am an experienced solutions architect and a full-stack LAMP developer (Linux, Apache/Nginx, MySQL/MariaDB, and Python/PHP) with working knowledge of Python, PHP, JavaScript, HTML and CSS with some experience of Perl, Java, and C#.

As of August 2024, I am producing a newsletter discussing open source software and my work in open source. You can read and subscribe at [opensauce.simonxix.com](https://opensauce.simonxix.com/).

## major projects

[Open Book Futures](https://copim.pubpub.org/pub/open-book-futures-announcement/) (2023-05 to present): Open Book Futures is a project to significantly expand key infrastructures created by Copim to achieve a step change in how community-owned open access book publishing is delivered. As part of this project, I am maintaining some project infrastructure and developing new experimental book publishing applications.

[Copim](https://www.copim.ac.uk/) (2020-08 to 2023-04): Copim was a project to build community-owned, open systems and infrastructures for open access book publishing. As part of the Copim project, I contributed to Work Package 6 on experimental book publishing by developing new web applications and solutions for experimental pilot projects and for the [Experimental Publishing Compendium](https://compendium.copim.ac.uk/). I also maintained the projectâ€™s infrastructure of Linux-based open source applications including the website, version control platform, and online document storage and collaboration platform. 

Soas Library Systems Replacement (2014-09 to 2015-07): In 2011, the Bloomsbury Library Management System consortium came together to discuss their shared need for new, next-gen library management systems. As a result of these discussions, Soas Library pursued a project to replace its legacy, proprietary library systems with next-gen open source replacements. I worked on a project team to implement [VuFind](https://vufind.org/vufind/) as a library catalogue and discovery system, OLE as a library management system, and [SobekCM](https://sobekrepository.org/) as a digital asset management system.
