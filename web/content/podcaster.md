Cinetopia is a organisation aiming to make film and filmmaking more approachable and diverse within Edinburgh and beyond.

## *You Are Being Unreasonable*

With my partner, [Helen Sulis Bowie](http://helensulisbowie.co.uk/), I co-hosted and produced the popular comedy podcast, *[You Are Being Unreasonable](https://anchor.fm/yabu)*, in which we examined the strange culture of Mumsnetâ€™s Am I Being Unreasonable forum. The archive of *You Are Being Unreasonable* is available on a wide variety of podcast platforms including [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/yabu), [Apple Podcasts](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/you-are-being-unreasonable/id1335692560?mt=2), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/1XUP0AxN8i150tktw3YU5Z), and [Google Podcasts](https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly9hbmNob3IuZm0vcy8yYTQyZDkwL3BvZGNhc3QvcnNz).
