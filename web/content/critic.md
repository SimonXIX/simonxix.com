## film criticism

As a film critic, I have reviewed films from a range of film festivals including BFI London Film Festival, Glasgow Film Festival, Fantasia International Film Festival, and BFI Flare LGBTIQ+ Film Festival. I have also appeared as a contributing film critic on the film review podcast and radio show, *[Cinetopia](https://anchor.fm/cinetopia/)*.

### Reviews Per Minute

In 2023, I am reviewing every film I see during the year with a word count that corresponds to the number of minutes long the film is. This project is called [Reviews Per Minute](https://reviewsperminute.simonxix.com/).

## cultural criticism

I am a culture writer focusing on contemporary cinema, video games, internet culture, and cultural representations of irony and sincerity. I have a Master’s degree in Cultural and Critical Studies from Birkbeck, University of London and wrote [my dissertation on New Sincerity in contemporary indie video games](https://hcommons.org/deposits/item/hc:32869/) with reference to *Twin Peaks*, David Lynch’s *Lost Highway*, and Guy Maddin’s *My Winnipeg*.
