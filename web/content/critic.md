I am a film critic and culture writer focusing on contemporary cinema, video games, internet culture, and cultural representations of irony and sincerity. I write regularly for various publications and speak regularly at conferences and other events.

## film criticism

As a film critic, I have reviewed films from a range of film festivals including BFI London Film Festival, Glasgow Film Festival, Fantasia International Film Festival, and BFI Flare LGBTIQ+ Film Festival. I have also appeared as a contributing film critic on the film review podcast and radio show, [Cinetopia](https://anchor.fm/cinetopia/).

## cultural criticism

I have a Master’s degree in Cultural and Critical Studies from Birkbeck, University of London and wrote my dissertation on New Sincerity in contemporary indie video games with reference to David Lynch’s work in film and TV and Guy Maddin’s My Winnipeg.

My fiction has been published in various literary publications and in New Scientist as the winner of their 2009 flash fiction competition.
